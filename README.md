# TweetGenerator
This project uses the Tweepy API which allows me to pull Data from Twitter and twitter accounts. 
In this instance, I get take a users account name and do text analysis and cleaning to determine the most frequent words they use. 
I also create a model which generates tweets which sound like the user I have inputted.
